CS410 Rust Programming

For those of you reviewing this code for Bart Massey's Rust programming class the most updated 
version of the code exists in the branch called "barr". At the current moment it still contains
one error that has yet to be resolved. The second part of the assignment hasn't been added by 
Larry Chiem and Andrew Wyat yet. They are both working on adding a visual keyboard to the project
once the synthesizer is working.
